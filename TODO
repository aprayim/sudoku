- Board class should just be that, we should have functions that do
    1) generate from basic file - DONE
    2) generate from scratch
        - create valid board (DONE)
        - backtrack solver should return multiple solutions (DONE)
        - disallow_except for {} input is wrong, also square->get_value shouldn't be a thing, basically go through from the bottom to determine what's what
        - next up is the algo on stackoverflow - create valid board, then keep removing until you find multiple backtrack solutions
    3) write to file with all allowed values info
    4) reads from that file
- at the very least make solve a static function but better make a solver interface class and let people use internal protected methods maybe?
- consolidate naked stuff into a template paradigm if you can
- consolidate hidden stuff into a template paradigm if you can
