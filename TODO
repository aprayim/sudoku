- import gtest stuff to cmake and remove any bazel dependency
- figure out how to use ninja with cmake instead of make
- get this to build and run in a docker container with ninja and gcc, poetry and the whole thing
- create a postgres db with tables etc - that you'll need to learn
    tables would be:
        - valid board table (id, valid board file etc..)
        - puzzle table (id, board file, valid board id)
        - techniques (puzzle id, technique) - you'll need to create an app that gives you techniques necessary to solve puzzle if the puzzle is solvable
- put this postgres db in a container as well, then run both containers simultaneously
- finally run all of this in google cloud although not sure how all this will work

improvements
- keep updating new techniques
- consolidate naked stuff into a template paradigm if feasible
- consolidate hidden stuff into a template paradigm if feasible
