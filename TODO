- Develop small apps, 
    1) create valid board,
    2) create X number of Sudokus from this valid board,
    3) Solve with returning an array of techniques used,
    4) Solve Brute Force
- create a docker file with bazel, gcc12 and any other dependency with a non-root user and build SUDOKU app in a container
- build the app with cmake
- modify github actions to use the image to spin up a container and build and test there

- at the very least make solve a static function but better make a solver interface class and let people use internal protected methods maybe?
- consolidate naked stuff into a template paradigm if you can
- consolidate hidden stuff into a template paradigm if you can
